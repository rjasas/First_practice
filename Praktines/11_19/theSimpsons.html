                            Marge Simpson is married to Homer and mother of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson.[3] She was raised by her parents, Jacqueline and Clancy Bouvier.[4] She has a pair of sisters, the joyless Patty and Selma, both of whom vocally disapprove of Homer.

                            Lisa is the most intellectual member of the Simpson family (she has an IQ of 159), and many episodes of the series focus on her fighting for various causes.[19] Lisa is often the focus of episodes with "a real moral or philosophical point", which according to former writer David S. Cohen is because "you really buy her as caring about it."

                            Maggie has performed a number of feats that for her age suggest she is highly intelligent, akin to her sister, and possibly a genius. She has spelled out E=MCÂ² with her baby blocks, driven Homer's car, escaped from the Springfield daycare center,[7] written her name on an Etch A Sketch,[6] played Internet poker.
